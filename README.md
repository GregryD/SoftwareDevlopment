How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
The best way to find the needs of the client is to meet with them and talk through what they are looking for.  It is important to take note of words like need, want, ideally to help prioritize what parts are important and what may not actually add value.  In agile we are attempting to build as little functionality as possible to give the client what they are looking for. 

How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are a way of stating what the user is specifically looking to accomplish.  Putting client requests into user stories helps the development team build the program, the product owner get a better grasp on what the client is actually looking for and create a basis for test cases that the tester can use to determine if the program is "done. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The agile process of breaking down problems into smaller bite size user stories is really helpful.  In the beginning of programming I would take a larger problem and try to solve the whole thing without any forethought about each part of the program.  By turning a problem into managebale user stories is a large help in build succesful programs that I actually solve through sequential steps.  

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Working together with others, using their stregnths to offset my weaknesses and being helpful to others makes work more purposeful.  To be a good team member is to listen to constructive criticism and improving, being able to provide criticism to others to help make them better, showing up to meetings, and being respectful to others feelings and personal life.  A well flowing team can be very difficult to stop but it does take some time to build the trust and grow together.
